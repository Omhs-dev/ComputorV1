5 * X^2 + 3 * X^1 = 5 * X^2 + 3 * X^1
0 = 0
All real numbers are solutions

0 * X^2 + 0 * X^1 = 0 * X^0
Reduced form: 0 = 0
All real numbers are solutions

Degree 1:

computor 5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 4 * X^0

Reduced form: 1 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 0
Polynomial degree: 1

Steps:
a = 4
b = 1

x = -b / a
x = -1 / 4
x = -0.25

Solution:
-0.25
